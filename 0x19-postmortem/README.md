## Postmortem: Internal Server Error Outage

##Issue Summary:
- `Duration:` The outage occurred from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC on March 15, 2024.
- `Impact:` During the outage, the web application experienced intermittent internal server errors (HTTP 500). Approximately 30% of users were affected, leading to degraded user experience and loss of revenue.
-`Root Cause:` The root cause of the internal server errors was traced to a misconfiguration in the Nginx proxy settings.

##Timeline:
- `12:00 PM UTC:` The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in HTTP 500 errors.
- `12:05 PM UTC:` It was noticed, and the issue during routine monitoring checks and began investigating.
- `12:15 PM UTC:` Initial investigations focused on application code changes and database performance.
- `12:30 PM UTC:` After ruling out application and database issues, attention shifted to the Nginx configuration.
- `1:00 PM UTC:` Misleading investigation paths included checking server logs for unusual activity unrelated to the issue.
- `1:30 PM UTC:` The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
- `2:00 PM UTC:` The issue was resolved by reverting the recent Nginx configuration changes and restarting the Nginx service.

##Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause:` The internal server errors were caused by a misconfiguration in the Nginx proxy settings, which led to incorrect routing of requests to the backend application servers.
- `Resolution:` The issue was fixed by reverting the recent changes in the Nginx configuration file to restore the previous working state. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to ensure the stability of the system.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- `Improvements/Fixes:`
  - Implement stricter review and testing processes for Nginx configuration changes.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect similar misconfigurations promptly.
- `Tasks to Address the Issue:`
  - Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in monitoring and response procedures.
  - Develop automated tests to validate Nginx configuration changes before deployment.
  - Train team members on best practices for Nginx configuration management and troubleshooting.

This postmortem highlights the importance of robust configuration management practices and proactive monitoring to prevent and quickly resolve service disruptions. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure the reliability and availability of our web application for our users.
